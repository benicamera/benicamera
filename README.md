### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello there, I am **Benjamin**. I'm currently conducting my corporate studies with SICK AG and DHBW Karlsruhe.

During my studies, I learn a lot of languages and techstacks. Among them are C#, C/C++, Java, Typescript and even NiFi.

When I'm not programming, I'm probably on my bike ore on a wakeboard :) 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a recipe recommendation app
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Vue.js
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects with realworld applications
